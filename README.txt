Horizon Professions is a highly configurable professions plugin designed for heavy RP servers. It was originally designed and written for my science-fiction roleplay server, Project Horizon, but I have been moving towards releasing it for other servers as well. The default configuration suits a science-fiction theme, but can be altered to work with medieval and modern servers just fine!

FEATURES

-Each player begins at the lowest tier in each profession and must progress by earning experience
-Intuitive progress display
-Fully configurable profession names and tiers
-Configurable tier cap (the maximum number of tiers a player can have in all professions)
-Configurable daily cooldown for level-ups and training
-Healing (item, profession requirement, tier requirement are all configurable)
-Award experience for healing

-Award experience for slaying monsters (in melee and with arrows)
-Award experience for block breaking
-Award experience for block placing

-Prevent/allow block breaking/placing based on profession and tier
-Train other players in a profession you are the top tier in (can be disabled)
-Configurable damage modifiers. Requiring to use a specific weapon may be specified.
-Player commands for viewing stats, undoing progress and resetting progress
-Admin commands for viewing others' stats, undoing others' progress, resetting others' progress and awarding tiers
-Admin notified when a player trains another player, or when another admin manipulates a player's professions.
-All notifications also logged in /plugins/HorizonProfessions/log.txt
-Awards permissions to players based on their profession and tier for easy interaction with other plugins
-Support for UUIDS 

DEPENDENCIES

Vault
This plugin has a hard dependency on Vault and will not load without it. Vault is middleware designed to centralise the many different permission and economy plugins out there, and allows Horizon Professions to function with any of them. You can download the latest version of Vault here: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/

RecipeManager
This plugin has a soft dependency on RecipeManager and is designed to work alongside it, but will work perfectly fine without. With RecipeManager loaded you will be able to configure Horizon Professions to award experience for custom recipes that are specified in RecipeManager. See the configuration for more information. You can download the latest version of Recipemanager here: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/recipemanager/ 


INSTALLATION

To install this plugin on your server, simply copy "HorizonProfessions.jar" into your "/plugins" directory. Upon the next server restart the plugin will be loaded automatically and a default configuration file will be generated. It is recommended that the plugin be configured for your individual needs. Once you are finished editing the configuration, you can apply your changes by typing /prof reload.
